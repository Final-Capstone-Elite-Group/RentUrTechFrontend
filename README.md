# RentUrTech React

> "RentUrTech React" is the front-end of the 'RentUrTech' full stack project(check the link to the back-end below). The main goal of this project is to provide users with an environment to reserve a specific product for a set amount of time. Thus, in this application users can create an account, get an authorization token, and retrieve all or one piece of equipment. They will be required to have an authorization token to manage their own reservations. For creating and destroying equipment, the user needs a proper role. Feel free to fork this project and modify it for your own use!
